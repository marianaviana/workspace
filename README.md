## Starting locally
After cloning the project, in the `index.html` file change line 8 removing `/workspace`. It should look like this:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/stylesheets/main.css">
```
This change must be made to correctly view the style, this is because this page is being used in a subdirectory of my domain.
